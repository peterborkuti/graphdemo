# graphdemo

Simple undirected graph

1) creating graph from string: 4:1,2;1,3;3,2

Node number:edge1;edge2;edge3
Because this is an udirected graph, you have to write every edge only once ( 1,2 is the same as 2,1)


2) BFS for this graph


3) shortest path from node X

It prints all the nodes' shortes distance from an abitrary node X
